<h1>🤖 E-Plucker Robot — Webots Simulation</h1>

By Team Syntax SquadFor IESL RoboGames 2024, University of Moratuwa<br><br>

<h2>🎯 Objective</h2>

This robot is designed to:

<ul>
<li>Follow a predefined black line on a track</li>
<li>Detect a specific color sequence:🔴 Red → 🟡 Yellow → 🌸 Pink → 🟤 Brown → 🟢 Green</li>
<li>Simulate a "plucking" action when each target color is detected</li>
</ul></br><br>


<h2>🧠 Technologies Used</h2>

🛠 Webots (Open-source robot simulator)<br>
🐍 Python (Controller scripting)<br>
🎨 Color Detection (Based on surface color beneath sensors)<br>
📏 Line Following (Simulated IR/reflectance sensors)<br>


<h2>📁 Project Structure</h2>

Demo Video => [line following robot video file]()<br><br>


<h2>🚀 Getting Started</h2>

1. Prerequisites
Download Webots
Python 3.x installed on your system<br>

2. Running the Simulation
# Open Webots
# Load the 'eplucker_world.wbt' file from the /worlds directory
# Hit 'Run' to start the simulation<br>

The robot will:

Begin line following
Detect colors in the predefined order
Perform a simulated plucking action at each color<br><br>
